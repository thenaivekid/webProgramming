## My True Love

show the big picture of myself.

////put the buttons at the end of each and ask if you have gone through it actively?

    If you are worthy, you deserve love.
    You can and you will find happiness and love.

    We are different.
    We Dream different.
    Our fate is different.
    But still need of love is the same.

## Introduction

        Most of this is the inner voices talking to me. And the remaining ones are the voices from around the world that resonated with me.


        THIS is actually made for myself to keep track of my progress and be organized while learning to be a better man, a better leader and a better engineer.

    	I am a teenage man. I have fallen in and out of love. And seen many people doing the same.
    	I found how important interpersonal relationships are for us humans who were programmed to live in a society and to help ourselves and others to find the happiness.

    	At the end of the day, all any of us want is to have some people to love, some achievements for pride and internal peace of mind for eternal happines.
Ask the following:
- What are you willing to struggle for?
- What pain do you want to endure?
- What are willing to sacrifice?

Purpose

    	I have found myself depressed because of love, girls and other stuffs. So, I want to show you what I learnt from my experiences of love, my obeservation of relationships. I have read dozens of self help books and watched uncountable youtube videos to find out how I am doing in love. Here I have provided the stuffs that I personally think that every gentleman must know.
    	If you want the truth this whole thing is created to remind myself. Rest is an excuse.

        When I write in first person I am the "speaker" repeating the words to myself to remember them and when I write in third person I am advicing myself.

    Love and Sex are proven to be good for health if a good health and a long happy life is what you want.
    This relationship is our nature. So, can't escape love the same way love can't escape us.

    First step
    	"There are plenty of fishes in the sea."
    	"You could be the best ice cream but still some people will prefer chocolate."

    Love
    	What do I know about love?
        Well nothing.
        We are just another animals. The society and technology decieves us to feel special. Three stages of love.
             1. attraction: spark of love. the amber.
             2. infatuation: desiring to be together, obsessing, wanting to know more,
             3. attachment: long lasting only developed after a long time spent together and sound knowledge of eachother.

THE ONE
//put the buttons at the end of each and ask if you have gone through it actively?
Evolution

    Man VS Woman

    Prefered personality

    Your expectations
    	List out your expectations from the lover. And your partner's wishes from you.

    Beauty
    	Beauty won't last long and it doesn't really matter if she/he looks like on of those women/men from the movies you watch in private. But still the first thing that attract us and bring us close so that we can find if she/he is the one. She/He may not have the current beauty after next 10 years but she/he has to be sufficiently seductive to keep you, the polygamous man, a monogamous creature.

    The Competition
    	Do you want her/him because there are so many others who are trying to get him/her.

    Interesting
    	Can you stay interested and not bored in his/her presence for significant amount of time.

    Similarities

    Differences

    Good health

    Caring and motherly

    How much irritation?
    	How much is your limit and how much does she irritate you? Dose she make you jealous.

    Change
    	How much she/he wants you to change? How much influence you can make on her? How likely is she/he to change?

    Blame
    	How much she/he blame you?

    Control
    	How much she/he wants to control you?

    Pride
    	Do you feel proud to be his/hers? Does he/she feel proud to be yours?

    Is she the one?
    	Come on man, you know it now.

APPROACH
//put the buttons at the end of each and ask if you have gone through it actively?

    Work
    Love is a two way street. You can't make her/him to fall in love with you. It needs to happen naturally. All you can do is be the best guy/girl and hope she/he will see the best guy/girl that you are.

    Impression

    when we meet someone for the first time our brain tries to find out most info about them.
        is he a friend or a foe?
        is he a winner?
        is he ally or enemy?

    	People make judgement and instead of changing their views they try to find evidiences that their impression of you is actually right. She/He associate how she/he felt around you at first to who you are, how powerful you are and how warm you are. Girls are far better observer than the boys. Girls can read immunity, amount of testesterone and lies.

    Make them do a little favor for you and thank them honestly.

    most importanly LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY find some similarity about person, context or interest. say me too and teach me? show similarity in interest, common acquantances, common organizations. thread theory find something common and dive deeper into it.

# Stories. people love stories.

always hunt for relatable, fun, imaginative and captivating stories to tell them.

- Start with a hook
- Epic struggle in the middle
- Use provocative works like 'perfume', 'coffee'.
- paint the vivid picture.
- make it boomerang: at the end they should be telling you their stories.

## Language of love

    	1.Talk of affirmation
    	2.Gift
    	3.Touch
    	4.Quality Time
    	5.Act of services

make a little note for each important people in your life.

- write down their personality trail, OCEAN scores
- their love language
- their values
- their passions, what drives them. what's holding them in the world.
- what offends them them.
- similarities and differences
- why you want or need them in life.

# H.O.T.A.P.E.

1.Humor: Be happy and transfer that energy
2.Open mind and open body language
3.Touch: non sexual touch
4.Attention: to your own actions and words and his/hers
5.Proximity: be close physcially till it's comfortable
6.Eye contact: firm eye contact

Achievements
Have achievements. Let her/him be proud to be yours. Be popular. Be competitive. Be the man of her dreams or the girl of his fantasies.

Vulnerability
If you are wild like me, let them tame you a little. If you are weak, let them empower you. Show your vulnerability and let him/her be the hero and appriciate his/her willingness to help.

Everything
Do everything that you believe will help you get him/her.

No Simping
Never SIMP Too much. I know in practical relationships you must ship a little. But stop if you don't recieve the same.

Worst case
What if you can't get him/her to come closer? What if she/he just doesn't want you to love?
Just leave them gracefully. She/He may throw tantrums. But you are a gentleman/a fine, remember? Say thank you. It didn't work. May next time I will find a better one. And may be I will be a better man/girl the next time.

TRACK MENSTRUATION
PMT, PMS and things like that.
"It's easier to negotiate with a terrorist than a girl on PMT."

    //make a calander, allow user to enter the first day of the period, then show what the girl experiences on that particular day. what the girl should do and what a aspiring boy should do.//

THE TOP

Staying

Now that you are on the top, you have to learn to stay on the top. It's the hardest.
What to do to keep her/him? Love her/him. Right? But how? They may not be able to read your mind. So, express them in a way so that she/he can see or feel what's on your heart. Keep the things interesting. Keep doing sweet things you used to do in the first few weeks.

1.  Caress
2.  Praise
3.  Pamper

    Nature has programmed males and females differently for our survival. Man is a hunter. Woman is a carer, nest defender and gatherer. Acknowledge the differences due to biology i.e. hormones, period and stuff like that.
    19.Fulfill her/his desires.
    20.Boys, LISTEN to her.
    I can't explain how important it is. Just listen. Let her feel like she's heard. Don't try to solve her problems. Just let her talk. LISTEN to what she has to say. Just do it and watch the magic happen.

        Set them free
        	If you find out that you have been mislead to beleive that she/he was the one or if she/he calls it quit, just be graceful. Leave it like it doesn't hurt. Grief in private but show them that you deserve better and you are going to get that better one.

      Am I being vain?
      Am I on on survival mode?

# self realization
I am myself vulnerable.
I am letting the wave sweep me.
I am collecting a lot of sufferings.
- to feel more alive, 
- to appriciate more
- to learn more stuffs.
These are all the things that I care about. 
- Challenges excite me.
- Pain makes me more alive.
- Helplessness makes me realize why I should be the man I want to be.


All the emotions are my slaves laboring 24/7 to make my life more beautiful, fulfilling and enviable. Anger, disgust and depression come and drown me. I will get over you soon and when I come asore, I will be a better man.

I want to live the true life, the life that the creator created  me for. Fuck the life of comfort, naivity and illusions. I don't wish to be happy, healthy and strong by eating chocholates, sitting all day and doing nothing. I want to struggle for the thing i want and I want to feel the truest happiness of achievement.  


I want to be an excellent observer, a passionate learner and a skeptical thinker so that I can reveive all the wisdoms that life is blessing me with.

There is a big conflict within myself that always holds me back. I want to be a big leader but at the same time I also want to be an ordinary, happy and fulfilled man. 
I have to believe that I am created special and I have to have an unshakable confidence to be the leader but I have to feel my insignificance and be uncertain of my judgements to be that ordinary man that Buddha taught me to be.

Beleive it. Struggle for it. Harness it.
