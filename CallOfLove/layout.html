                    Most of this is the inner voices talking to me. And the remaining ones are the voices from around the world that resonated with me.


                    THIS is actually made for myself to keep track of my progress and be organized while learning to be a better man, a better leader and a better engineer.

                    I am a teenage man. I have fallen in and out of love. And seen many people doing the same.
                    I found how important interpersonal relationships are for us humans who were programmed to live in a society and to help ourselves and others to find the happiness.

                            At the end of the day, all any of us want is to have some people to love, some achievements for pride and internal peace of mind for eternal happines.
                    Ask the following:
                    - What are you willing to struggle for?
                    - What pain do you want to endure?
                    - What are willing to sacrifice?
                </div>
                <br>

                <div class="content">
                                
                    Purpose

                            I have found myself depressed because of love, girls and other stuffs. So, I want to show you what I learnt from my experiences of love, my obeservation of relationships. I have read dozens of self help books and watched uncountable youtube videos to find out how I am doing in love. Here I have provided the stuffs that I personally think that every gentleman must know.
                            If you want the truth this whole thing is created to remind myself. Rest is an excuse.

                            When I write in first person I am the "speaker" repeating the words to myself to remember them and when I write in third person I am advicing myself.

                        Love and Sex are proven to be good for health if a good health and a long happy life is what you want.
                        This relationship is our nature. So, can't escape love the same way love can't escape us.

                            "There are plenty of fishes in the sea."
                            "You could be the best ice cream but still some people will prefer chocolate."

                        Love
                            What do I know about love?
                            Well nothing.
                            We are just another animals. The society and technology decieves us to feel special. Three stages of love.
                                1. attraction: spark of love. the amber.
                                2. infatuation: desiring to be together, obsessing, wanting to know more,
                                3. attachment: long lasting only developed after a long time spent together and sound knowledge of eachother.

                    Triple threat:

                    - HANDS spaced a little from the torso
